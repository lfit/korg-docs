Requesting a new wiki site
==========================

.. important:: Do you really need a wiki?

   Back in the rosy days of the early Internet, wikis made perfect
   sense. Today, unless you're willing to constantly monitor your wiki
   for spam and abuse, you shouldn't really be asking to set up a wiki.
   What you probably want instead is a documentation site. Please review
   :doc:`docs`, and strongly consider if it's a better fit than having a
   wiki.

We provide both mediawiki and dokuwiki sites -- our preferred solution
being dokuwiki as it is more lightweight and looks cleaner. To request a
new wiki site, please send the following information to
helpdesk@kernel.org:

- Desired wiki software: Dokuwiki (preferred) or Mediawiki (discouraged)
- Name of the site: [foo.wiki.kernel.org]
- Reasons for the site: [Kernel module documentation, etc]
- LFID of the administrators: [to obtain your LFID, create an account on https://identity.linuxfoundation.org/ ]
