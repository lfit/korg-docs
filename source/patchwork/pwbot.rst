Git Patchwork Bot
=================
If you have received an automated notification from a friendly bot, this
is because the maintainers to whom you sent your patches rely on
Patchwork_ to track, review and apply the patches they receive from
contributors.

You are awesome, thank you!

.. _Patchwork: https://patchwork.kernel.org/

I don't want these!
-------------------
If you do not want to receive these notifications, simply add the sender
address (patchwork-bot+[projectname]@kernel.org or
notify+[projectname]@kernel.org) to your block/auto-archive filter.
Please don't mark it as spam, because doing so may cause you to no
longer receive email from other kernel developers.

It missed some of my patches!
-----------------------------
The bot is only able to recognize the patches that weren't significantly
changed. If your patches were tweaked for variable naming, comments,
whitespace, or other stylistic purposes, then the bot will no longer be
able to make a reasonable match.

Opt-in notifications for Next/Mainline
--------------------------------------
.. note:: This is a beta feature

You can opt in to receive notifications for when your patches are
applied to linux-next or mainline. Follow the instructions on the
`feature announcement page`_.
