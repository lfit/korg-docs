Obtaining and setting up your Nitrokey
======================================

As a developer with a kernel.org account, you qualify for a free
Nitrokey smartcard, sponsored by The Linux Foundation. Please read the
announcement and follow the links from the page to order your Nitrokey:

* `Program Announcement <https://www.kernel.org/nitrokey-digital-tokens-for-kernel-developers.html>`_
* `Nitrokey store front <https://kernel.nitrokey.com/>`_
* `Maintainer PGP Guide <https://docs.kernel.org/process/maintainer-pgp-guide.html>`_
* `Nitrokey setup instructions <https://www.nitrokey.com/documentation/installation#p:nitrokey-start&os:linux>`_

Switching your ssh access to use the Nitrokey
---------------------------------------------

If you've added an Authentication subkey, we'll be happy to switch your
ssh access to use it instead of the private key issued to you during
account creation. Please email helpdesk@kernel.org to request this
change.
